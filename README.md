**TASK 2**

# Retail Sales Visualization, Relationship Analysis & Business Insights

## 1. Project Overview

This project analyzes a retail sales dataset using Python and data visualization techniques. The main focus is to understand sales, profit, discount, product categories, and relationships between numerical variables.

## 2. Libraries Used

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

### Explanation

* Pandas is used for data loading and data analysis.
* NumPy is used for numerical operations.
* Matplotlib is used to create basic plots.
* Seaborn is used for statistical visualizations.

## 3. Loading the Dataset

```python
df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/big data analysis/samplesuperstore.csv")
```

### Explanation

The Sample Superstore CSV file is loaded using Pandas and stored in the DataFrame `df`.

The dataset contains 10,194 records and initially has 21 columns.

## 4. Viewing the Dataset

```python
df.head()
```

### Explanation

`head()` displays the first five rows of the dataset. It helps understand the structure and type of information available.

The dataset contains fields such as Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Customer information, Region, Category, Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit.

## 5. Dataset Information

```python
df.info
```

### Explanation

This is used to inspect the DataFrame information, including columns and data types.

## 6. Descriptive Statistics

```python
df.describe()
```

### Explanation

`describe()` provides statistical information for numerical columns such as:

* Count
* Mean
* Standard deviation
* Minimum
* 25th percentile
* Median
* 75th percentile
* Maximum

The average Sales is approximately 228.23 and the average Profit is approximately 28.67.

## 7. Date Conversion

```python
df["Order Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Order Date"])
df["Ship Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Ship Date"])
```

### Explanation

The Order Date and Ship Date columns are converted into datetime format so that date-based calculations can be performed.

## 8. Checking Data Types

```python
df.dtypes
```

### Explanation

This code displays the data type of every column.

After conversion, Order Date and Ship Date are stored as datetime values, while Sales, Discount, and Profit are numerical values.

## 9. Creating Delivery Days

```python
df["Delivery Days"] = (df["Ship Date"] - df["Order Date"]).dt.days
```

### Explanation

A new column called `Delivery Days` is created by calculating the number of days between the Order Date and Ship Date.

This helps analyze delivery duration.

## 10. Checking Product Categories

```python
print(df["Category"].unique())
```

### Output

```text
['Office Supplies' 'Furniture' 'Technology']
```

### Explanation

This identifies the unique product categories available in the dataset.

The three categories are:

* Office Supplies
* Furniture
* Technology

## 11. Checking Missing Values

```python
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

### Explanation

This checks the number of missing values in every column.

The analysis shows that there are no missing values in the dataset.

# Part 1: Sales Analysis and Bar Plots

## 12. Sales Distribution

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.hist(df["Sales"], bins=20)
plt.title("Distribution of Sales")
plt.xlabel("Sales")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
```
**OUTPUT:**
<img width="558" height="393" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74a7c887-6f09-419f-984d-c68bbdda70a8" />



### Explanation

A histogram is used to understand how Sales values are distributed across the dataset.

`bins=20` divides the Sales values into 20 groups.

### Analysis

This visualization helps understand the frequency and distribution of sales values.

## 13. Total Sales by Category

```python
category_sales = df.groupby("Category")["Sales"].sum()
print(category_sales)
```

### Explanation

`groupby()` groups the data according to Category and `sum()` calculates the total Sales for each category.

### Result

```text
Furniture          754747.7613
Office Supplies    731893.3140
Technology         839893.2790
```

### Analysis

Technology has the highest total sales among the three categories.

## 14. Sales by Category Bar Plot

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.bar(category_sales.index, category_sales.values)
plt.title("Sales by Category")
plt.xlabel("Category")
plt.ylabel("Sales")
plt.show()
```

**OUTPUT:**
<img width="566" height="393" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eadd3f52-551d-4ada-b48a-6c6899d3c74b" />

# Part 2: Box Plots

## 17. Profit Distribution

```python
sns.boxplot(
    data=df,
    y="Profit"
)

plt.title("Profit Distribution")
plt.ylabel("Profit")
plt.show()
```
**OUTPUT:**

<img width="592" height="416" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0cda38f-6486-47e2-9fcb-70ab28ba360c" />


### Explanation

This box plot shows the overall distribution of profit values.

It helps identify:

* Median
* Spread of profit values
* Variation
* Outliers

### Analysis

This visualization helps understand how profit values are distributed and whether there are unusual profit values.

## 18. Profit Variation Across Categories

```python
sns.boxplot(
    data=df,
    x="Category",
    y="Profit"
)

plt.title("Profit Variation Across Categories")
plt.xlabel("Category")
plt.ylabel("Profit")

* `y="Profit"` displays profit values on the Y-axis.
* Each box represents the profit distribution of a category.

### Analysis

This visualization helps compare profitability, variation, median values, and outliers across categories.

# Part 3: Discount vs Profit Analysis

## 19. Checking Discount Levels

```python
df["Discount"].unique()
```

### Explanation

This code displays all the unique discount levels available in the dataset.

### Analysis

It helps identify the different discount values used in the sales records.

## 20. Impact of Discount on Profit

```python
sns.scatterplot(
    data=df,
    x="Discount",
    y="Profit"
)

plt.title("Impact of Discount on Profit")
plt.show()
```
**OUTPUT:**
<img width="592" height="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62b4d8ce-e086-4d94-9367-a9ade5d5563d" />


### Explanation

This scatter plot is used to analyze the relationship between Discount and Profit.

* `x="Discount"` represents the discount level.
* `y="Profit"` represents the profit.
* Each point represents a sales record.
* `sns.scatterplot()` creates the scatter plot.

### Analysis

The visualization helps understand how profit changes at different discount levels.

It can be used to identify whether higher discounts are associated with lower profit and to observe the impact of discounting on profitability.

# Part 4: Correlation Heatmap

## 21. Selecting Numerical Attributes

```python
numeric_df = df.select_dtypes(
    include="number"
)
```

### Explanation

This code selects only the numerical columns from the dataset.

Numerical attributes are required for correlation analysis because correlation is calculated between numerical variables.

## 22. Creating Correlation Matrix

```python
corr = numeric_df.corr()
```

### Explanation

The `corr()` function calculates the correlation between all selected numerical attributes.

Correlation shows the strength and direction of the relationship between numerical variables.

## 23. Correlation Heatmap

```python
sns.heatmap(
    corr,
    annot=True
)

plt.title("Correlation Heatmap")
plt.show()
```
**OUTPUT:**
<img width="609" height="518" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36a685f7-38b2-4f87-b9d2-8bcc83161e54" />


### Explanation

This heatmap provides a visual representation of the correlation matrix.

* `corr` contains the calculated correlation values.
* `annot=True` displays the correlation values inside the heatmap.
* `sns.heatmap()` creates the heatmap.

### Analysis

The correlation heatmap helps identify relationships between numerical attributes such as Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit.

# 24. Overall Analysis
